# Rust TDD Starter
Simple starter for getting started with TDD in Rust.

The file _src/calculator.rs_ contains one test case and a few in comments. Start by coming
up with a few test cases and add them to the lists, then implement them one at a time, test-driving the
solution forwards.

## Libraries
- _rstest_ for parametrizing tests

## Running
Tests are run by Cargo. Execute:

```shell
$ cargo test
```

to run all the tests.
